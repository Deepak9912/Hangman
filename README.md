# Hangman!
Hangman is a word game where the goal is to guess the words until you can guess the complete word. The user will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters that they will need to find.

Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).

If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appear will be revealed.

After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.

User can only guess six wrong letters, for every wrong guess, user will lose one life and hangman will appear piece by piece.

If user cannot guess the word and exceeds the lives, the game will be over and hangman will die.
